The issue can be solved by using multiple CSS rules and avoid using percentage values directly with other units in `calc()`. For example, instead of using the following code:

```css
.element {
  width: calc(50% - 10px);
}
```

Use this instead:

```css
.container {
  width: 100%;
}

.element {
  width: 50%;
  margin-left: 10px;
}
```

This ensures that the percentage is calculated correctly before other units are applied.
